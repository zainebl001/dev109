            <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>Before taking this class, I had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS from some online tutorials. However, my knowledge of JavaScript was minimal, with only a few basic scripts and concepts understood.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
            <p>I built my portfolio from scratch. I wanted to have complete control over the design and functionality, and I felt that creating it from scratch would give me a better learning experience and a deeper understanding of web development concepts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> What was the most challenging part of your portfolio?</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was ensuring usability throughout the whole process and stress testing for errors to ensure a completed project.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
            <p>This class gave me a greater appreciation for the complexity and creativity involved in web development. I learned that itâ€™s not just about coding but also about designing user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
            <p>Future students should practice coding regularly and not hesitate to ask questions or seek help when needed. Utilizing online resources, participating in forums, and building small projects on the side can greatly enhance their understanding and skills.</p>
